# chess-engine

A chess engine developed for educational purposes (no cheating).

My model (for details, refer to `model/info.txt`) has shown poor results. Based on my experience, its estimated rating ranges from 400 to 700 ELO.

## Setup:

- Install Python dependencies:

    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

- Put your data (.pgn files) into ```data/pgn/```. 

> The [dataset](https://database.nikonoel.fr/) that I used.

- Refer to ```chess_engine.ipynb``` for further instructions and actions.
